# atproto-website

This is the repository for the documentation for the AT Protocol. You can read the documentation [here](https://atproto.com/).

## Installation

To make edits to the documentation, clone this repo. Run `npm install`. 

Run the development server with `npm run dev` or `yarn dev`. 

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
